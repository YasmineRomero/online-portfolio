                        <img src="images/essay-1.jpg" id="essay1" alt="My essay titled Digital Responsibility: Conscious Creators of Content.">
                        <p class="p-indents">I wrote this piece in my English class at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), covering how students at CART could benefit from a curriculum covering how to be conscious of the content they post online. This excerpt is a portion of a longer research essay and was written in academic prose and MLA format. I chose this sample since this shows my research abilities and how I can pull together information for an argumentative essay and use statistics to help further explain my points. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QDcl7XDUkLmgCZX9h9foaWO2OFg6bdA4T41jeeEvUO4/edit?usp=sharing">Read More...</a></p>

                        <img src="images/essay-2.jpg" id="essay2" alt="My essay titled Ready Player One in English Classes.">
                        <p class="p-indents">I also wrote this piece at CART, which was an argumentative essay on whether or not the book <i>Ready Player One</i> by Ernest Cline should be used in English classes, and I argued for the use of the book. This excerpt is a part of a longer essay and was written using academic prose and MLA format. I selected this sample since it shows how I can place myself in the shoes of my peers and see how the book could be beneficial to them while also having the book be a good use of time for teachers. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XH91gTDfR3gQ1ejzDl8WQJIc1uaWyvxOTqRGpycO_s4/edit?usp=sharing">Read More...</a></p>

                        <h2><b>Writing Sample 3:</b> "Brutus: The False Hero"</h2>
                        <img src="images/essay-3.jpg" id="essay3" alt="My essay titled Brutus: the False Hero.">
                        <p class="p-indents">I wrote this final piece at Clovis North High School during my Junior year, which was an argumentative essay on whether or not the character Brutus from <i>Julius Caesar</i> was a hero. I argued that Brutus was not the hero that some people said that he was. This excerpt is part of a longer essay written in academic prose and MLA format. I selected this sample because it shows my analysis of characters while comparing them to other important historical figures. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPQdIj7mdDoqn_9urXQhYl70cn4-jpUaKZ1H2HdexIU/edit?usp=sharing">Read More...</a></p>
