                <p class="p-indents">Hi, my name is Yasmine Romero and I currently live in Madera, California. I’m attending Clovis North High School as well as the Center of Advanced Research and Technology. I’m a music enthusiast and also am passionate about web development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-it">
                <p class="p-indents">I have always had an intense passion for computers. It all began just about the time that I could figure out how to type on a keyboard. Since I’ve been using computers for so long, I was able to build up my typing speed to about 80 words per minute. In my sophomore year of high school, I started to try and learn the basics of HTML. When I got accepted into the Center for Advanced Research and Technology, I was able to start learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. I have also worked on projects where I got experience working with people on my team and collaborating ideas.</p>

                <p class="p-indents">Music has been a passion for me, and I taught myself everything that I know. Starting at 14 years old, I began picking up some skills for several instruments. I have experience with guitar, ukulele, recorder, pennywhistle, violin, and piano. I am the most experienced on the guitar, ukulele, and the violin. For the guitar, I can play songs like If I Had You by Adam Lambert and thnks fr th mmrs by Fall Out Boy. On the ukulele, I can play songs like Rolling in the Deep by Adele and Kiss Me Kill Me by Mest. On the violin I can also play songs like Imaginary by Evanescence and My Demons by Starset. I have even made a few original songs in the process of learning these wonderful instruments!</p>
            </div>
		    <p class="p-indents">My future plans are to go to California State University, Fresno and get a bachelor's degree in computer science. Within five years, I will have hopefully completed my college education and started securing a job within the technology field.</p>
