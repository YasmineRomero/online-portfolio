				<p>Since I need to learn how to draw clothes other than the standard t-shirt and monocolor pants, I decided to go with a new kind of outfit. I decided to come up with a not too fancy dress and an overcoat that connects with a "golden" chain to support it. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

			<h2>Song Portfolio</h2>
			<p>I always had a burning passion to learn how to make music and to play instruments ever since I was a child. At seven years old, I became determined to learn my first instrument. Due to reasons beyond my control, I was unable to play any instruments until I was fifteen years old. At this point, I finally saved up enough money to buy my first instrument: the acoustic guitar.</p>
			<p>The acoustic guitar is what really got me interested in music. Nothing in my life could ever compare to the wonderful sound that guitar strings make when played just right. Thankfully, within two weeks, I learned how to play my first song: If I Had You by Adam Lambert.</p>
			<p>In no time, I picked up an electric guitar, recorder, ukulele, and penny whistle. I aspire to pick up more instruments in the future.</p>
